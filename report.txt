1. Introduction

My task is to implement minimax or alpha-beta pruning
to play tic-tac-toe and connect-4. 
With the help of the pseudocode from the textbook and 
the assignment description, I should make a working algorithm
that will play tic-tac-toe and connect-4. 

2. Methods

I tried to pretty much exactly replicate the pseudocode from the
textbook, except I had to figure out how to implement it into
this program. After figuring out the variables and functions of
this program, I was able to write the code for minimax and 
alpha beta pruning with little problems. I ran into a problem
when my program was not choosing the optimal moves, but I had been
using both the min and max functions from the pseudocode, and I 
found that using the max function recursively worked. This is because
the computer should want to maximize their score, not minimize. 

3. Results

When playing tic-tac-toe, I was able to get both alpha-beta pruning
and minimax to pick out the optimal moves 100% of the time. However, 
when I try to run connect-4, neither work and once player 1 makes a 
move, the program doesn't make a move and is stuck loading in the 
next move. I don't know if this is a result of connect-4 being a 
more complicated game than tic-tac-toe, but it doesn't have any errors
so I just have to guess that the search algorithm is running but 
is too slow for an advanced game like connect 4.
